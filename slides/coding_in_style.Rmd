# You

* Know how to code!

--

* Collaborate with others and/or your past self on a regular basis.

--

* Have never been trained in how to write "good code". 

???
What I'm assuming about you:

You know how to code!

You collaborate with others and/or your past self on a regular basis.

But you have not necessarily been trained in how to write "good code".

# dumpster or Dumpster?

* They all use style guides.

???

Conversations about style in the newsroom can involve something as simple as the decapitalization of “dumpster” (thanks to the loss of a trademark), or as complex as a word like Brexit.

# Coding style

>"Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, butitsuremakesthingseasiertoread"

> Hadley Wickham, [The Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)


--

* We're going to look at a few R and Python style guides together. 

???

Let's look at a quote from the Tidyverse Style Guide by Hadley Wickham: Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can manage without it, but it sure makes things easier to read.


---
# Style guides

* A set of rules about style. 

???
So what are style guides? Well they're a set of rules about style.

--

* All style guides are fundamentally opinionated.

???
All style guides are fundamentally opinionated. 

--

* Some decisions make code easier to use but many are arbitrary.

???
Some decisions make code easier to use, for example matching indenting to programming structure, but many are arbitrary. 

--

* Most importantly a style guide provides **consistency**.

???

One of the most important things a style guide provides is consistency!!

--
* It makes code easier to write because you need to make fewer decisions. 

???
It makes code easier to write because you need to make fewer decisions. It also provides a consistent standard.

# R style guides 

* [Tidyverse Style Guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html); [Google R Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.html) (forked from the Tidyverse style guide). 

--

**Tidyverse Style Guide**

* **Files:** Names, Organisation, and Internal Structure.

--

* **Syntax** Object names, Spacing, Function calls, Control flow, Long lines, Semicolons, Assignment, Data, Comments. 

--

* **Functions** Naming, Long lines, return(), Comments

--

* **Pipes**, **ggplot2**, **Packages**

---

# File: Names

File names should be **meaningful** and end in `.R`.

--

* **Meaningful:** something concise, that still evokes its contents. 

--

* Avoid using special characters in file names, stick with numbers, letters, `-`, and `_`.

--

1.    foo.r
2.    fit_models.R
3.    fit models.R
4.    stuff.r
5.    utility_functions.R

* Which file names are good or bad?

--

If files should be run in a particular order, prefix them with numbers. 

--

* +10 files? left pad with zero:


    00_download.R, 01_explore.R, ... 09_model.R, 10_visualize.R

--

* Pay attention to capitalization!


???

Since you, or some of your collaborators, 
might be using an operating system with a case-insensitive file system (e.g., 
Microsoft Windows or OS X) which can lead to problems with (case-sensitive) 
revision control systems.

Prefer file names that are all lower case and **never** have names that differ only in their capitalization. 
---
# Files: Internal Structure

* Start by loading your libraries all at once at the beginning of the file. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
```

--

* Use commented lines of `-` and `=` to break up your file into easily readable 
chunks.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Load data ---------------------------
# Plot data ---------------------------
```

---
# Syntax: Object Names

## Object names

> "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and 
> naming things." 
>
> Phil Karlton


* Variable and function names should use only lowercase letters, numbers, and `_`. 

* Use underscores (`_`) (so called snake case) to separate words within a name. 

--

```{r, eval = FALSE}

DayOne
day_one
day_1
dayone
```

Which names are "good" or "bad"?

---
# Syntax: Comments

* In data analysis code, use comments to record important findings and analysis decisions. 

--

* If you need comments to explain what your code is doing, consider rewriting your code to be clearer.

--

* If you discover that you have more comments than code, consider switching to RMarkdown. 

---
# Functions: Naming

* **Variable names** = nouns, **function names** = verbs. 

* Avoid re-using common functions and variables.


```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
add_row()
permuter()

# Bad
row_adder()
permutation()
```

* N.B. Google prefers identifying functions with `BigCamelCase` to clearly distinguish them from other objects.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Good
DoNothing <- function() {
  return(invisible(NULL))
}

```


---
# Functions: long lines

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
long_function_name <- function(a = "a long argument",
                               b = "another argument",
                               c = "another long argument") {
  # As usual code is indented by two spaces.
}
# Bad
long_function_name <- function(a = "a long argument",
  b = "another argument",
  c = "another long argument") {
  # Here it's hard to spot where the definition ends and the
  # code begins
}
```

???

If a function definition runs over multiple lines, indent the second line to 
where the definition starts.

---
# Functions: Comments

* Use comments to explain the "why" not the "what" or "how".

* Each line of a comment should begin with the comment symbol and a single space `#`: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good

# Objects like data frames are treated as leaves
x <- map_if(x, is_bare_list, recurse)

# Bad

# Recurse only with bare lists
x <- map_if(x, is_bare_list, recurse)
```

Comments should be in sentence case, and only end with a full stop if they
contain at least two sentences.

---
# R packages supporting the tidyverse style guide. 

There are two R packages that support the "tidyverse style guide"

* `styler` - allows you to interactively restyle selected text, files, or entire projects. 

* `lintr` performs automated checks to confirm that you conform to the style guide. 

---
# Python style guides

* [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) (works well with PyCharm)

--

* [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

--

* [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)

---

# PEP8 Code Layout

* Indentation
  * 4 spaces per indentation level
* Maximum line length
  * Max of 79 characters
* Tabs or spaces
  * Spaces
* Blank lines
  * Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.
  
---
# Naming Conventions

### Package and Module Names

* Modules should have short, all-lowercase names. 

* Underscores can be used in the module name if it improves readability.

--

### Class Names

* should normally use the CapWords convention

--

### Function and Variable Names

* Function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores.

---
# Comments

* Use inline comments sparingly!

--

* Comments that contradict the code are worse than no comments!!

--

* Comments should be complete sentences.

--

* Ensure that your comments are clear and easily understandable to other speakers of the language you are writing in.


???

One of the parts of the Pep8 style guide that is contentious is the emphasis on English, especially as it is worded in the Pep8 guide https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/: "Python coders from non-English speaking countries: please write your comments in English, unless you are 120% sure that the code will never be read by people who don't speak your language." 

---
# Packages in Python

* `pylint` - a Python static code analysis tool which looks for programming errors, helps enforcing a coding standard, sniffs for code smells and offers simple refactoring suggestions.

* `Flake8` - is a Python library that wraps PyFlakes, pycodestyle and Ned Batchelder's McCabe script. It is a great toolkit for checking your code base against coding style (PEP8)

???

pylint and Flake8 are a few packages that are used to lint and tidy code.

# Reflections

* What do these style guides have in common?

* What aspects are most difficult to implement?

* What parts of coding aren't covered by the style guide?

* What did you find interesting/surprising?

`r countdown(minutes = 10, seconds = 00)` 

---
# My reflections

**Things in common**

--

* Naming conventions (to distinguish different elements)

--

* Formatting rules (for readability/identifying changes)

--

* Names should be meaningful!

--

**Most difficult to implement**

--

* Meaningful names.

--

**What they didn't cover**

--

* Compartmentalisation (e.g. functions sources from functions.R)

--

**What I found interesting**

--

* Use comments sparingly

--

* Code should "speak for itself". Be clear and self-explanatory!
